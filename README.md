INTRODUCTION
------------

This project was done as part of a Graph Theory Module i undertook in third year final semester. The Aim of this module was to provide a formal introduction into graph theory,
specifically graphs and digraphs. The learning outcomes were to gain a theoretical foundation for modelling solutions to complex problems using graphs as an abstract data type.
This module also provided insight and knowledge about the history, current state, and important developments of the concepts widely used in graph theory.

CONTENTS
--------

Heap Sort Jupyter Notebook:

- Explaination of the Heap Sort algorithm
- Heap Sort Implementation (Python)
- computational complexity of Heap Sort
- Graph Theory and Heap Sort

Graph Isomorphism Jupyter Notebook:
- Explaination of the Graph Iomorphism Problem
- Explaination of hwo graphs can be presented with Data Structures
- Graph Isomorphism/Adjacency Matrix Implementation (Python)
- Discussion of the Computational Complexity of Graph isomorphism

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This Project Requires the following resources:

Latest Version of Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Latest version of Jupyter : https://jupyter.org/

Note: Google collab and github also make these notebooks viewable

INSTALLATION
------------
Installation step by step guides are available on relevant websites.
(Note: For anaconda make sure to add anaconda to your path, this is an option during installation.)

DESIGN DECISIONS
----------------

This notebook is designed to be understood by both beginner and knowledgeable programmers/students of Graph Theory.It has a focus on explaining and showing examples of the discussed topics and 
outlining any major recognised problems, efficiencies , inefficiencies of given topics and explaining any need to know pieces of information related to the topics.
